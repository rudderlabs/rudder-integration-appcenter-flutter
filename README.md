## Integrating AppCenter with the RudderStack Flutter SDK

1. Add [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).

2. Open `pubspec.yaml`  and add `rudder_integration_appcenter_flutter` under `dependencies` section:

```groovy
dependencies:
  rudder_integration_appcenter_flutter: ^1.0.0
```

3. Navigate to your Application's root folder and install all the required dependencies with:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Import the module you added above and add it to your SDK initialization code as shown below:

```typescript
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderClient.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderConfig.dart';
import 'package:rudder_integration_appcenter_flutter/Appcenter.dart';

RudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();
builder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);
builder.withTrackLifecycleEvents(true);
builder.withFactory(Appcenter());
RudderClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY,
    config: builder.build());
```
